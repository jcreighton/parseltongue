Hello! Thanks for reviewing this project! I chose to do a Harry Potter-themed game since I'm unfamiliar with the original game and also, hello, I am a nerd.

Here are some improvements I didn't get to:
  - NOT storing everything in global scope (super aware this is bad, would never do in production)
  - Planned on using import/export but did not want to run a server to prevent CORS issues
- Code for placing "food" without collision is inefficient as it will take more time to find non-collision coordinates at the snake grows
- UI is basic, I chose to focus on the game functionality instead of the UI
